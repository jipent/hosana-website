Grace Greater Than All Our Sin

Marvelous grace of our loving Lord
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt
Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt

Grace, grace, God's grace
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
Grace, grace, God's grace
Grace that is greater than all our sin

Dark is the stain that we cannot hide
What can avail to wash it away?
Look, there is flowing a crimson tide
Whiter than snow you may be today

Grace, grace, God's grace
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
Grace, grace, God's grace
Grace that is greater than all our sin

Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace
Freely bestowed on all who believe
All who are longing to see His face
Will you this moment His grace receive?

Grace, grace, God's grace (marvelous grace, infinite grace)
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
Grace, grace, God's grace (marvelous grace, infinite grace)
Grace that is greater than all our sin
